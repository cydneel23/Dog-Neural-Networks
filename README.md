# Dog-Neural-Networks

This is a project that was completed as part of the course, "Complete Machine Learning & Data Science Bootcamp 2023" by Andrei Neagoie & Daniel Bourke.

The purpose of the project is to use ML tools (neural networks) to be able to classify any given image of a dog as a certain dog breed.
